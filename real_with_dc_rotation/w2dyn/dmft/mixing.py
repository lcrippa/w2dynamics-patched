"""Module for mixing functionality.

Provides classes that calculate new proposal/trial values from the history of
previously seen results in ways that accelerate the convergence of the loop to
its fixed point.

Apart from classes implementing different mixing algorithms,
- LinearMixer for linear mixing of the previous result
- DiisMixer for Pulay mixing/DIIS of the result history
- NoMixingMixer for no mixing
there are also the decorator classes InitialMixingDecorator, which
allows switching mixers after a number of iterations, as well as
FlatMixingDecorator and RealMixingDecorator, which resp. flatten the
input and separate its real and imaginary parts before passing it on
to the decorated class, which mainly serves the purpose of bringing
more convoluted input quantities into a form suitable for use with
DiisMixer.

All mixer objects are callable, taking the new values as argument and
returning the next proposal/trial value.
