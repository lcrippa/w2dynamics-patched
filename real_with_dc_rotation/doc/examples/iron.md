# Ferromagnetic bcc Iron, a comparison between Density-Density, Kanamori and full-Coulomb interaction #
## Introduction ##
A short introduction maybe with some references to the literature.
gitlab automaticall makes links from links: https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.7293

Here is the link into the repository: [README](https://w2dynamics.physik.uni-wuerzburg.de/W2Dynamics/W2Dynamics/raw/master/README.md).

## Hamiltonian and Notation ##
A short introduction to the Hamiltonian and especially to the notation that is relevant later on.

## Relevant Observables and why they are Interesting ##
A section introducing the observables and why they are interesting

### Observable 1 ###

### Observable 2 ###

### Observable 3 ###

## Setting up the code for the simulation ##
Stuff that belongs here:
- config files
- changes to the code
- necessary CPU investment (single-core laptop or multicore workstation or Super Computer)

## Runtime Monitoring ##
This is still a Monte Carlo code so you should probably check and rerun the results.

## Where to Find the Actual Data ##
This should include the relevant parts that give you actually the numbers of the observables from the files.
This could also give links to benchmark data so that users can benchmark their results against that.

## Discussion of the Results ##
This is the place for all the physical discussion.

## Conclusion and Outlook ##
Some place where you can put your publications.
## Future Work and Current Projects ##
